# This is a template for the actual .env file.
# The .env file is used to store private information like database credentials and file paths.

# INSTRUCTIONS
# 1. Create a file named '.env' in the WEB-INF folder of the project ('Project_TIW/src/main/webapp/WEB-INF').
# 2. Paste the content of this template into it.
# 3. Add the .env file to your .gitignore (this should already be done â€” check to be sure).
#    This prevents sensitive data from being committed to GitHub.
# 4. Replace the placeholders below:
#    - Insert your actual database name inside DB_URL (in place of DB_NAME).
#    - Set your MySQL username and password in DB_USER and DB_PASS.

# 5. Choose a folder on your computer where uploaded images will be saved.
#    IMPORTANT: This folder must be OUTSIDE the project directory.
# 6. Copy the full path to that folder into UPLOAD_DIR.
#    Make sure NOT to use backslashes '\':
#    - Use double backslashes '\\' if necessary
#    - Or better, use forward slashes '/' (they work on Windows too)

DB_URL=jdbc:mysql://127.0.0.1:3306/DB_NAME?serverTimezone=UTC
